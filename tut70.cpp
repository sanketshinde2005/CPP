// Containers in STL
/*
Containers are themselves of three types:
1. Sequence Containers
2. Associative Containers
3. Derived Containers

# Sequence Containers
A sequence container stores that data in a linear fashion.Sequence containers include Vector, List, Dequeue etc. These are some of the most used sequence containers.

#Associative Containers
An associative container is designed in such a way that enhances the accessing of some element in that container. It is very much used when the user wants to fastly reach some element. Some of these containers are, Set, Multiset, Map, Multimap etc.  They store their data in a tree-like structure.

# Derived Containers
As the name suggests, these containers are derived from either the sequence or the associative containers. They often provide you with some better methods to deal with your data. They deal with real life modelling. Some examples of derived containers
are Stack, Queue, Priority Queue, etc.
