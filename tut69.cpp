// Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ (Theory)
/*
What is STL?
An STL is a library of generic functions and classes which saves you time and energy which you would have spent constructing for your use. This helps you reuse these well tested classes and functions umpteenth number of times according to your own convenience.To put this simply, STL is used because it is not a good idea to reinvent something which is already built and can be used to innovate things further.

We have three components in STL:
1. Containers
2. Algorithm
3. Iterators
