// Object oriented programming (OOP)
/*
#Procedure Oriented Programming
1. Consists of writing a set of instruction for the computer to follow
2. The main focus is on functions and not on the flow of data
3. Functions can either use local or global data
4. Data moves openly from function to function
# Object-Oriented Programming
1. Works on the concept of classes and object
2. A class is a template to create objects
3. Treats data as a critical element
4. Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects
